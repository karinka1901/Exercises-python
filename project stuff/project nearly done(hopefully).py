5. You get a 50% Co2 refund for that particular flight.\n\
4. Your plane had to return to the previous airport. Full amount of Co2 wasted for that trip.\n\
3. Your planes GPS breaks and you end up at a random destination anywhere in the world.\n\
2. You had to take an unexpected detour. Double the amount of Co2 consumed.\n\
