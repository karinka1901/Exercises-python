Your starting location will be random. From that point you can choose to fly to any country, however the airport will be random. \nYou have 3 rounds/lives, you collect 100 points for each continent per round. However if you die you do not keep your score\n\
Every time before you fly a dice of destiny will be rolled. The outcomes of the rolls are as follows:\n\
6. You get a full Co2 refund for that particular flight.\n\
5. You get a 50% Co2 refund for that particular flight.\n\
4. Your plane had to return to the previous airport. Full amount of Co2 wasted for that trip.\n\
